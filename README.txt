COMPILE,RUN,CLEAN:
To compile the program simply type "make" and then to run it right after
type "make run", after using it you can type "make run" to run it again or 
"make clean" to clean its compiled files.

IN PROGRAM:
When in the program, you will be asked for a word. All words present in the dictionary are the words given in the Dictionary.txt.
If the word is present in the dictionary the program will return "True‚Äù, any words starting with the first two letters, and the operation time for
getting the words. If the word is not present in the dictionary but is close in similarity to another word that starts with the same letter
then the program will return the suggested word, ask yes or no, and if "yes" it will do what I said above and if "no" it will return "False". The last
case is when the word entered is not present in the dictionary and not like any words starting with the same letter then it will return
"False". After any of these cases the program will exit.
